<h3>Introduction</h3>

Hovering is a simple meditation technique which can be practiced almost anywhere!

We recommend using the official <a href="https://Hovering.neverfapdeluxe.com/" class="link">Hovering Web App</a>, although the Hovering Android App is also suitable.

You can even use a piece of paper with a circle drawn on it, although a lot of people find the interactivity of the web app helps them better engage with their Hovering.

<h3>Instructions</h3>

These instructions apply to the Hovering Web App.


- Relax.

This is the first most vital step which a lot of people either completely ignore or skip out entirely.

Ultimately there are two aspects to Hovering: Building your capacity for conscious awareness (which is the Hovering itself) and learning to remain calm.

If you're not remaining calm and relaxed while you practice it, then you're not developing the skills required in order to effectively remain balanced.

So always remember to bring yourself to a relaxed state before practicing Hovering, otherwise you're never going to truly 'get it'.

And this rule really applies to anything do in life, whether it be martial arts or academia. Learning to relax is an important first step, which Hovering itself also teaches.


- Place your cursor within the hover button.


A large part of Hovering is about learning to remain physically stationary for a period of time as a way to develop self-control.

So that's what we are going to be doing with our cursor.

It will help us mentally link our physical actions with our internal outcomes, such as realising that remaining physically and mentally stationary allows us to have increased control over the decisions we make on a daily basis.

Because we're no longer being judgemental or over-thinking.

Essentially the mindset you practice while you're Hovering is the mindset you should be applying to your daily lives as a course of excellent mental health. 

Of course, the only way you're going to have these realisations or develop these skills is by consistently practicing Hovering and by consistently remaining stationary without thought.

This is why it's important that you practice Hovering regularly.

- Ensure your hand remains physically connected to your cursor.

This is also another thing which people don't do, and yet is vital to correct Hovering. 

The whole idea behind remaining physically connected to the cursor is to demonstrate control.

In other words, it demonstrates that you are in-control of the cursor at all times and that you're making a conscious decision to remain stationary.

And not react to your thoughts and feelings which say otherwise, which is to say that you can stop Hovering at any moment, but instead you're choosing to commit to your mental health.

Reinforcing this physical idea of commitment is in part what makes Hovering so powerful.


- Focus your vision and attention on the hover button.

Once you're physically grounded to the button, the next step is to focus your attention on the button. 

For most people, this means gazing at the button and maintaining our focus and vision on the button itself.

What this teaches you is to be present with yourself, without feeling or expectation. 

Of course, it's important to understand that these realisations will only make sense through practice. You may not experience being "without feeling or expectation" when you start out.

But through practice you can develop your own similar understandings.


<h3>Daily Routine</h3>

In order for Hovering to be effective, it's absolutely vital that you practice it for at least 10 minutes each day. 

Personally speaking, I practice it 10 minutes before bed because that's the schedule which suits me most.

Ultimately it can help to understand that these are skills we are developing at the end of the day, which means they can only be learned through consistent practice.

Practice and consistency truly are the only two things which matter to improving your mental health.

<h3>Rookie Mistakes</h3>

The biggest mistake newcomers to Hovering make is that they get so caught up in the technique of how to do it, that they forget the most important fundamental step. 

Which is to relax.

I really cannot emphasise this enough, because this is where 90% of people go wrong.

What I find personally helps is to just take a few deep breaths and to focus my attention on some object in front of me for a few seconds before I begin Hovering.

So I can mentally prepare myself for the next 10 minutes ahead.
