<h3>Introduction</h3>

Hovering is a simple meditation technique.

There are many different ways you can practice it, whether on your computer, on your mobile phone or even with a simple piece of paper with a circle drawn on it. 

I personally recommend using the dedicated web app we have built to practice hovering with:

<h3>Instructions</h3>

These instructions apply to the web app, although I would focus on the basic principles. 


- Firstly, you must relax.

This is the most vital first step which a lot of people don't even think about.

There are two aspects to Hovering: Building your capacity for conscious awareness and learning to remain physically and mentally calm.

If you're not remaining calm and relaxed while you practice it, then you're not truly practicing Hovering.


- Place your cursor within the hover button.

The idea is to leave this cursor within the hover button while we practice hovering.

Why is this important?

Essentially it's all about learning to remain physically stationary for a period of time as a way to develop self-control, as well as to link our physical actions with our outcomes.

This is essentially what you should be doing with your mind, learning to remaining stationary without thought.

Of course, if it were that simple none of us would need to meditating within the first place.

This is what we will be practicing, and essentially forms the basis of hovering.


- Ensure your hand remains physically connected to your cursor.

Doing this is vital to hovering correctly. 

The whole idea is to demonstrate real control, because by engaging in hovering you are essentially committing to a physical action which you are consciously directing.

Which is to say that you can stop hovering at any moment, but instead you're mentally choosing to commit.

This is really important because it teaches us the importance of commitment.


- Focus your vision and attention on the hover button.

Once you're physically grounded to the button, the next step is to focus your attention on the button. 

For most people, this means simply gazing at the button. What this teaches you is to be present with yourself, without feeling or expectation.


<h3>Rookie Mistakes</h3>

The biggest mistake that newcomers to Hovering make is that they get so caught up in the technique of how to do it, that they forget the most important step. 

To relax and not stress. 

Hovering shouldn't be a tense or agitating experience, full of worry or expectation. It's merely you being present with yourself in this very moment. 


<h3>Daily Routine</h3>

In order for Hovering to be effective, it is absolutely vital that you practice it for at least 10 minutes each day. 

Personally speaking, I practice it before bed because that is the schedule which suits me best.

It can help to understand that these are skills we are developing at the end of the day. You won't have these abilities now of being complete balanced, but with practice you can develop them.
