Hovering is a very simple meditation technique.
****
There are many different ways you can practice it, whether on your computer, on your mobile phone or even with a simple piece of paper with a circle drawn on it. 

I personally recommend using the dedicated web app we have built to practice hovering with:

<h3>Instructions</h3>

These instructions apply to the web app, although I would focus on the basic principles. 


- Firstly, place your cursor within the hover button.

The idea is to leave this cursor within the hover button while we practice hovering.

Why is this important?

Essentially it's all about learning to remain physically stationary for a period of time as a way to develop self-control, as well as to link our physical actions with our outcomes.

This is essentially what you should be doing with your mind, learning to remaining stationary without thought.

Of course, if it were that simple none of us would need to meditating within the first place.

This is what we will be practicing, and essentially forms the basis of hovering.


- Ensure your hand remains physically connected to your cursor.


Doing this is vital to hovering correctly. 

The whole idea is to demonstrate real control, because by engaging in hovering you are essentially committing to a physical action which you are consciously directing.

Which is to say that you can stop hovering at any moment, but instead you're mentally choosing to commit.

This is really important because it teaches us the importance of commitment.
