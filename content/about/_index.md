Hovering is a meditation technique has been designed to assist people in the 21st century.

It was created as part of <a href="https://neverfapdeluxe.com/" class="link">NeverFap Deluxe</a>, a website I created to help people suffering from porn addiction.

You know when something just clicks and it finally makes sense for the first time, and it just changes the way you think about things?

That's ultimately what meditation aims to achieve.

Once meditation finally made sense to me, it completely and utterly changed the way I think about life in ways I couldn't possibly describe.

The problem is that this is rare. Most people meditate for a bit, it doesn't click, and then they put it off for years.


Hovering aims to address that by providing an intuitive way to think about meditation, that isn't completely abstract.


That anyone can relate to, especially those who have never taken the time to study meditation, awareness, mental health practices etc.

Especially children and teenagers.
