Hovering itself is a form of meditation.

So really this article what we will be comparing the technique of hovering against traditional meditation.

For those unaware, traditional meditation usually involves sitting silently in a room with your eyes closed, as you learn to observe your senses.

It is a perfectly valid way to meditate and if you would like to learn more I highly recommend that you read <a href="https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/observe-your-senses" class="link">this article</a> which explains the technique in more detail.

<h3>What is Observation?</h3>

The problem with traditional meditation is that a lot of people struggle with this idea of "observation".

In part because it's a relatively abstract idea, but largely because people simply don't know how to actually observe.

Which sounds silly, but is actually a key reason why people suffer from mental illness and addiction, because they're unable to truly observe and remain aware.

In order to understand many of us go to this point, it can help to understand the conceptual opposite of observation: 

Thought.

<h3>Struggling with Thought</h3>





Especially if you're deep in depression, suffering from the effects of addiction or simply don't have a solid understanding of mental health best practice.

Like, what does it actually mean to observe your senses?
