            My name is Julius Reade and I run a porn addiction recovery website. In doing so I’ve become aware of many of the limitations of existing approaches towards mental health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Especially for today’s generation of young people, as well as most adults I speak with as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a lot of the teenagers I speak to really struggle not only to understand this idea of meditation, but to do something as simple as keep their minds still for a period of time. Not only because it’s a skill which they’ve yet to develop, but also because it’s not how they’re being brought up in regards to their day-to-day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, most teenagers have become stuck within this paradigm of constantly checking some sort of digital device,

          <p>You know when something just clicks and it finally makes sense for the first time, and it just changes the way you think about things?</p>
          <p>That's ultimately what meditation aims to achieve.</p>
          <p>Once meditation finally made sense to me, it completely and utterly changed the way I think about life in ways I couldn't possibly describe.</p>
          <p>The problem is that this is rare. Most people meditate for a bit, it doesn't click, and then they put it off for years.</p>

          <p>Hovering aims to address that by providing an intuitive way to think about meditation, that isn't completely abstract.</p>

          <p>That anyone can relate to, especially those who have never taken the time to study meditation, awareness, mental health practices etc.</p>
          <p>Especially children and teenagers.</p>
